## Professional Information
I´m an accomplished, hands-on, & well informed IT professional with 15+ years of experience in providing strategic guidance regarding IT technology and infrastructural enhancements to clients and organizations. I´m very keen on all topics around Cloud-Native Technologies and software-defined-everything and I like to share this passion with you through this blog.

Since 2019, I'm proud to mention that I'm one of a few team members of the Open Source project [VMware Event Broker Appliance](https://vmweventbroker.io). This project provides an event-driven approach to interact with VMware's solutions using Functions as a Service.

Within VMware´s Professional Service Organization <a href="https://www.vmware.com/professional-services.html" target="_blank">(PSO)</a>, I´ve started my journey back in October 2016 as a Technical Account Manager. In case you don´t know exactly what a TAM does, I´d like to forward you to this -> <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/11/vmware-technical-account-manager.html" target="_blank">post</a> which describes it in perfect words.

## Certifications

I passed several industry certifications over the years during my career in IT but I decided to not list them all here. Basically, all of them are Server, Storage and Virtualization focused. If you are interested in which ones exactly, please feel free to have a look at my <i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-fw"></i> profile: [Robert Guske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-guske-830853111/).

Nevertheless, those are my latest three certifications I've made/passed:
